need to create a symbol table in the semanticAnalyzer that stores the symbols and types
(types or size of memory needed) and also has a spot for the relative address it will be
at

keep code to a minimum. Less intructions = faster code in gnereal. like: since multiply
and divide always have to end up in rax, use rax for expression handling so there is less
shifting around of values

in general, the gen function of declarations and assignment will only fuck with the AR
and heap. Expressions and function calls will fuck with the stack

dragon book has some general code gen algorithm in 9.6
