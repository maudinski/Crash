if a function has 2 seperate for loops, and both are declaring the same type for the
for counter (for int i = 9, for int j = 7), you can use the same memory address in the
AR for both of them (as long as the loops aren't nested, goes without saying)
^^ may not be the point. Quote from dragon book - "tries to transform the intermediate
code (ast) into a form from which more efficient target code can be produced". Prolly
just stretch out for loops, idk. ch 10 in db
