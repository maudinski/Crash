For structs, lex, parse and semantic analyze them first (maybe force them to be in a
seperate file, thought that's really dirty). Then add those to the lexer as types, that
way it will be sort of automatic. Also, a struct initialzer will be
StructName s = StructNameInit(5, "hello", 4) (fields in order). That is actually a
function that the compiler will automatically generate depending on the struct that returns
said type. Not sure how to do the parsing on that though, will figure it out

will prolly just be a block in memory of relevant size (slack bytes and ___)
